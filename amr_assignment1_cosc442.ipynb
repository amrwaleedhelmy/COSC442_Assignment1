After using experimenting different testing metrics such as Euclidean and Manhattan distances with A*, we noticed that the Manhattan distance is more suitable than the Euclidean distance in places such as urban areas characterized by grid-based layouts since it calculates the distance as the sum of horizontal and vertical movements, aligning better with the grid-like nature of urban streets, thus, it enables more efficient exploration of the search space, even amidst numerous turns and intersections.\n",
